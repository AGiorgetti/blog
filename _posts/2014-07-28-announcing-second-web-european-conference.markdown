We did it in [October 2012](http://2012.webnextconf.eu/), and we are [doing it again](http://webnextconf.eu/): we are organizing the [2nd Web European Conference](http://webnextconf.eu/) for Spring 2015, somewhere in Italy.

The conference will be about **Modern Web Development**, no matter which platform: .NET, Node.js, Ruby, JavaScript.

### Our Manifesto

**Modern web development** is moving away from all the _enterprisey_ features that used to rule the world of development in the past years, and is going toward a more light-weight and simple approach. 

*   **Code Craftsmanship**: Developers are taking back the control, of the code they write, on how they write and on which tools make them productive.
*   **Tiny assemblable frameworks**: Gone are the huge monolithic frameworks from one vendor: Modern Web Apps are a mix and match of different frameworks, technologies and languages.
*   **BYOT**: Bring Your Own Tool: Modern Web Development is about productivity the way you want it, not the way the vendor wants it to be.
*   **Mobile First**: Web sites are now mostly viewed on mobile devices: web sites and apps must be built with that in mind.  

### Call for presenters

To make an awesome conference we need awesome speakers, and today we are also launching the call for presenters: if you want to propose a talk that matches the ideas of our Manifest, you can already submit your proposal. Go on our [Github account](https://github.com/Web-European-Conference), fork the [c4p repository](https://github.com/Web-European-Conference/c4p), add your proposal and submit a pull request.

### Call for sponsors
