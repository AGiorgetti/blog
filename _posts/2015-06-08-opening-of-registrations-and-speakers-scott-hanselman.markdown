You all already know the date of the conference, the 26 September 2015. Now there is another important date to mark on your calendar: **1st July 2015**, at noon, the registration for the conference will open.

In the previous edition, we filled in the capacity of the venue (170 seats) in less than one hour: this year we'll have a bigger venue, with more than 400 seats, but if you want to get your seats for this free conference, be on the site on time.

If you attended the previous edition, you'll be able to pre-register before the official registration opens. Also if you are registered to our mailining list you'll have an head-start. So, go to our website [http://webnextconf.eu/](http://webnextconf.eu/ "http://webnextconf.eu/") and subscribe to the mailing list.

### Speakers

The call for presenters will stay open till the end of June, but today we are very happy to announce that we've secured two amazing speakers: **Scott Hanselman** and **Dino Esposito**.

Thanks to the hospitaly of the [University of Milano-Bicocca](http://www.unimib.it/go/102/Home/English) the conference will be free to attend, but we'll need your help to make it the best conference ever. 

### Call for presenters
